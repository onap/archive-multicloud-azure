# The PYTEST_PROCESSES environment var is used in tox.ini to override the --numprocesses argument
# for PyTest's xdist plugin. The reason this is necessary is that conventional Travis environments
# may report a large amount of available CPUs, but they they are greatly restricted. Through trial
# and error we found that more than 1 process may result in failures.
